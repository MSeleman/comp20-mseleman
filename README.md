What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)

The purpose of this git repository is to manage and perserve the devolopment of my COMP20 coursework over the course of the semester. Not that COMP20 is coming to an end, the repository will serve as a great display of what I've learned in COMP20 and all that I've created with the skills that I've developed thus far. 


What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?

My favorite assignment was Assignment #2: Landmarks because it was the first assignment during which I created something that I thought would have some value to someone other than myself. I was very excited with my final product, and showed it to several friends. In retrospect, I think I was more excited about the fact that what I had learned thus far in COMP20 was already enough for me to build something of utility. 


How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?

I'd say I've grown exponentially as far as my knowledge of the web is concerned. Week by week, I feel as though I've gotten a much better grasp of how the web works both at big picture level and with some great insight into the nitty gritty details. Most of all, though, I feel that COMP20 has taught me how to learn on my own to solve problems that may at first seem daunting. 


What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.

As I mentioned above, I think one of my most valuable take aways from this class stems from my experience learning on my own rather than being told exactly what to do or how to complete a certain assingment. For example, I was at first frustrated with some of the gray areas in the Assignment #2 spec, but then realized that this was opportunity to customize my work in whatever way I saw fit, which lead me to learn a lot more on my own than I ever would have, had I been spoon fed precise directions. I also remember struggling with CSS during Assignment #1, and having to look up a lot. I remember actually learning a lot more than I needed to at the time, which has really helped me out later in the semester as I work on the interface for my semester group project. 


Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?

I am really excited to dive a bit deeper into cyber security. See in COMP116 next semester, Ming!
